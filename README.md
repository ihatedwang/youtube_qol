Really crappy chrome extension to fix some of their BS layout design. Code is absolute trash and inefficient but I just needed something to work...

* [homescreen] Change sizing of youtube thumbnails (window size / 600)
* [homescreen, search results] Auto hide youtube shorts
* [homescreen, search results] Auto hide yotube playables

Issues:
* Will break if youtube changes element name
* Youtube has thumbnail loading issues if you display too many videos per page
* Thumbnail sizing cannot be applied to search results due to how the default layout works
* No settings are applied to channel page
