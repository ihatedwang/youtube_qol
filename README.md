Really crappy chrome extension to fix some of their BS layout design. Code is absolute trash and inefficient but I just needed something to work...

* Change sizing of youtube thumbnails (window size / 450)
* Auto hide youtube shorts
* Auto hide yotube playables

Issues:
* Will break if youtube changes element name
* Youtube will having thumbnail loading issues if you display too many videos per page
