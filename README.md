Really crappy chrome extension to fix some of their BS layout design. Code is absolute trash and inefficient but I just needed something to work...

Features:
* Extension UI to adjust YouTube layout
* Custom video thumbnail size on homepage
* Toggle on/ off Shorts shelf on homepage and search results
* Toggle on/ off Playables shelf on homepage and search results

Does not support:
* Custom video thumbnail size on search results
* No customization is allowed on channel pages

Known issues:
* Will break if youtube changes element name
* YouTube has thumbnail loading issues if you display too many videos per page
* YouTube page does not refresh/ update when toggle value changes
